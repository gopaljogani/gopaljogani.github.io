*Unsupervised learning tasks consist in finding structure in **unlabeled** data without a specific desired outcome.*

Supervised learning can be further separated into multiple subtasks (the separation is not as clear as in the supervised setting):
* **Clustering**: can you find cluster in the data?
* **Clustering**: can you find cluster in the data ?
* **Density Estimation**: what is the underlying probability distribution that gave rise to the data?
* **Dimensionality Reduction** how to best compress the data?
* **Outlier Detection** which data-point are outliers?

Due to the lack of ground truth labels, it difficult to measure the performance of such methods, but such methods are extremely important due to the amount of accessible unlabeled data.
