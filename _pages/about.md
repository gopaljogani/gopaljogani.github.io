Hello!

I'm a PhD student in machine learning at Stanford University co-advised by [Percy Liang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/) and [Tatsu Hashimoto](https://thashim.github.io/) and funded by a [Knights-Hennessy Scholarship](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/). 

I strive to build AI technologies that are simultaneously open/accessible to all and safe/ethical. 

Before starting my PhD, I traveled around trying to reconcile my passion for machine learning research and my entrepreneurial mindset.
On the research side, I've worked extensively on **learning representations** of data that provide guarantees (fairness, robustness, etc) on downstream machine learning.
For example, I've worked on such projects at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) with [Chris Maddison](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cmaddis/) and as part of my [Facebook AI Residency](https://research.fb.com/programs/facebook-ai-residency-program/). 
On the entrepreneurial side, I've worked on applied AI projects at different startups. For example, developing algorithms at [Grab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grab_(company)) to analyze text in under-research languages (Thai, Khmer, Burmese, ...); or predicting room occupancy at [SBS](https://sensiblebuildingscience.com/) to decrease the carbon footprint of large buildings in Vancouver.

Outside of machine learning I spend my time playing sports with friends (:ski:,:mountain:,:badminton:,:volleyball:,:runner:), traveling, or reading about geopolitics.
